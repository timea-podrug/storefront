## Description

This project is a storefront built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It's my first time working with both technologies. I had a total of one month to complete the project, with two weeks dedicated to actual development. The initial two weeks were spent familiarizing myself with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and working with APIs, particularly the Medusa API. Although I wasn't able to successfully implement the Medusa API, the experience allowed me to gain valuable insights into building a web application.

The part I am most proud of in this project is the Product Detail page. Additionally, the fact that I was able to create something functional without prior experience in these technologies is a personal achievement.

## Project Structure

I structured the project by following a component-based approach, breaking down larger components into smaller, reusable ones. This approach allowed for easier maintenance, improved code readability, and flexibility in reusing components across the application.

Key components include:

- `pages`: Contains the pages for routing and rendering different sections of the storefront.
- `components`: Houses reusable components that are utilized throughout the project.
- `styles`: Includes global styles.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash

```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
